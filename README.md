#TODO:
- [x] change: reading specifier on token
- [] general usage: %\[flags\]\[width\]\[.precision\]\[length\]specifier ->  flags [x] specifiers [x]
- [x] feat: flags ['-', '+', '#', 0]
- [] fix: print pointer out 
- [] fix: insertion of token spaces needs peek 
- [] fix: write function 
- [x] feat: lexer peek function
