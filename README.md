# My Own printf
## What I Have Done?
Yeah, everything is a mess around here. I didn't stop to fix things up, organize, or clean the code (more like I cracked the code... hum? hum? Anyway).

But hey, this project was a something. Variadic functions, lexers, tokenizers, memory management—
it's been fun. C is still a mystery to me, a whole new world of low-level to discover and deep CS concepts, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it, dunno maybe.

## Why I Did It?
Because I can.

## How It Works
This implementation takes a format string, processes it, and prints stuff just like printf. Well, almost. It supports:

Basic format specifiers: **%c**,**%s**,**%d**,**%x**, etc.

Variadic arguments: Otherwise why, right?

Custom parsing logic: No dependencies, just pure C.

What's Next?
This is for me, right? And now I'm just talking to myself. I never thought I would fall in love with code again. The state of this project is a mess (at the moment), 
but crossing throughout this gave me so much confidence. Remember: mini-shell, text editor, gameboy image processor emulator.
